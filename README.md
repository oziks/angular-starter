# angular-starter

My minimal starter for an angular project using [**bower**](http://bower.io/) and [**gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/).

## Initialization

Run the `install.sh` script.

It automatically updates your project's name and author. Don't forget to delete it after execution.

## Installation

Install **bower** and **gulp** globally using npm:
```bash
$ npm install -g bower gulp
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
$ nmp install
$ bower install
```

Run **gulp** to build assets:
```bash
$ gulp
```
